# i18n SSR & Hydration Verification Report

## Visual Output
- Screenshot saved as `homepage-i18n.png` in the workspace root.

## Translation Rendering
- All visible translation keys (`hero.title`, `hero.subtitle`, `features.*`, etc.) are rendered as raw keys (e.g., `hero.title`) in the DOM, indicating translations are **not** being resolved.
- No translated content is visible; only keys are shown.

## Runtime & Network
- No hydration warnings or SSR errors detected in logs.
- No network errors or 404s for `/locales/{lng}/{ns}.json` observed.
- SSR and hydration complete without runtime exceptions.

## Diagnosis
- `react-i18next` is initialized and provider is wrapped correctly.
- The translation JSONs exist and are accessible.
- The i18n config is correct (`useSuspense: false`), but translations are not resolving.
- Likely cause: i18next backend does not load resources on the server during SSR, so keys are rendered instead of translations.

## Next Steps
- Consider using `i18next-fs-backend` for SSR or preloading resources server-side.
- For full SSR support, load translations before rendering and hydrate client with the same resources.

**Status:** i18n system is not resolving translations in SSR/hydration. See screenshot for details. Further SSR resource loading configuration is required.
