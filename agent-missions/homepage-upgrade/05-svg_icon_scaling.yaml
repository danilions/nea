  Fix the oversized and misaligned SVG icons on the homepage.
  Ensure all icons are styled with consistent Tailwind sizing classes and respect their viewBox settings to integrate cleanly into the layout.

steps:
  - name: Identify affected icons
    files:
      - src/components/ui/
      - public/assets/
    verify: |
      - Find all <svg> elements or imported SVGs used in HeroSection, FeatureSection, and other key blocks
      - Confirm which icons are displaying oversized in the live site

  - name: Normalize SVG usage
    check: |
      - All inline <svg> have correct viewBox attribute
      - Dimensions are controlled via Tailwind (e.g., w-8 h-8 or w-12 h-12)
      - No fixed pixel sizes overriding container flow

  - name: Update icon wrappers
    files:
      - src/app/components/IconFeature.tsx (or equivalent)
    fix: |
      - Wrap each icon in a div with defined flex sizing
      - Use Tailwind responsive sizing (e.g., w-10 h-10 sm:w-12 sm:h-12)
      - Add aria-hidden or alt text if icons are decorative/informative
