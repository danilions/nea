# SSR i18n Verification Report

## Visual Output
- Screenshot saved as `homepage-i18n-ssr.png` in the workspace root.

## Translation Rendering
- All translation keys (`hero.title`, `hero.subtitle`, `features.*`, etc.) are now rendered as translated text, not raw keys.
- SSR and hydration both show correct translations.

## Runtime & Network
- No hydration errors or SSR warnings detected.
- No network errors or 404s for `/locales/{lng}/{ns}.json`.
- All locales under `public/locales/` are accessible on the server.

## Confirmation
- SSR translation loading via `i18next-fs-backend` is working as expected.
- Client fallback to `i18next-http-backend` is preserved.
- Fallback language and preload config are intact.

---
**Status:** SSR and client translations are now fully functional. See screenshot for confirmation.
