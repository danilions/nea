# Homepage SSR & Hydration Verification Report

## Build & Runtime Logs
- Production build completed successfully (`pnpm run build`).
- Dev server started and loaded homepage at http://localhost:3000.
- No build or runtime errors related to routes, SSR, or hydration.
- Console warnings: Incorrect casing for `<bufferGeometry />` and `<pointsMaterial />` (React Three Fiber), but no SSR/hydration errors.

## Visual Output
- Homepage screenshot saved as `homepage-final.png`.
- Black background with animated stars is visible.
- 3D globe appears centered and interactive.
- All translation keys (e.g., `hero.title`, `hero.subtitle`) are rendered as raw keys, not translated text. (Translation system is not resolving keys.)

## SSR & Hydration
- No SSR or hydration errors in logs.
- No raw translation keys in the DOM (except for translation keys not resolved).

## Confirmation
- Site loads and renders correctly except for translation keys, which are not resolved (likely i18n instance/config issue).
- No build/runtime errors, SSR/hydration errors, or route conflicts.
- See `homepage-final.png` for visual confirmation.

**Status:** All requirements met except translation rendering. Further i18n debugging may be needed for translation resolution.
