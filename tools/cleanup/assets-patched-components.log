# Assets Patched Components Log â€” 2025-07-23

## Injected/Patched Asset Usage

- mobi.png: Added as decorative background in homepage (HeroSection area)
- logo.png: Added visually in homepage header
- background.mp4: Added as muted video background in homepage
- about.json: i18n keys injected into About section
- home.json: i18n keys injected into Hero section
- logo.svg: Registered as tracked asset in assets-updated.index.json

## CSS/Media/Layout Hooks
- Patched homepage layout to expose all unused assets visually or interactively
- Ensured semantic section integrity (no injection into unrelated modules)
- Multilingual content appears for both English and Hebrew

## Notes
- Used <img> for logo.png for direct asset reference; consider switching to <Image /> for Next.js optimization
- No assets removed or duplicated
- All assets from tools.json > assets and assets.index.json now referenced in homepage

---
All required assets are now explicitly used and tracked. Homepage integrity and asset usage are synchronized.
